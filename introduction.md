### Introduction & Background

With power of face recognition, many previous unimaginable tasks become tangible and achievable.

However, cost, in both human force and pecuniary investment, for creating large-scale and pure face dataset is still very high. Only big companies and institutions have enough support to construct such dataset as mentioned above and some are not open-source, which restricts the development for both industry and academic research. As shown in fighure 1,
LFW is an commonly accessible face dataset but it only contains 10k+ pictures, in which only 1680 people contain two or more distinct pictures.

### Existing Work 

Face recognition has been one of the most successful techniques in the field of artificial intelligence because of its surpassing human-level performance in academic experiments and broad application in the industrial world. 

Gaussian-face[1] and Facenet[2] hold state-of-the-art record using statistical method and deep-learning method respectively. What's more, face recognition has been applied in various areas like authority checking and recording, fostering a large number of start-ups like $\text{Face}^{++}$.
